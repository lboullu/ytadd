# ytadd
A python script to add items from playlist to other playlists with time and date criteria

For example, the command

ytaddpara.py -i "UU0d8ioz_MWw0UlqcOsosIJg" -o "PL9MuAUzO08ldBFee_iLpWZWiX6yM5fvWI" -c 10 -a "WL" -d "2020-05-03"
````
adds the videos from CribblingDepression Channel which are more then 10 minutes long to my \[S\] playlist, and those that are less then 10 minutes to my Watch Later playlist


You need to initiate the script by going through the authentification stage [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python).
